# HoleDet


## Prototyping Phase ToDos:

### setup etc
- [x] datasets (stfm, ask asl? look online, matt asks, ask eric)
- [ ] find more stfm pcl datasets (laurent)
- [ ] setup repo structure
- [x] install libraries (c++: pcl, python: open3d)
- [x] google drive (laurent)
- [x] laurent and mau zedong muessen lesen
- [x] matt dumps pcl code in repo
- [x] define fixed weekly meeting (mau doodle)
- [x] define this week update meeting (mau)
- [x] write email jeff (nasib)

### exploration
- [x] general data exploration (clustering, local statistics, etc.) (matt)
- [ ] mesh approach (nasib)
- [ ] height diff stuff (moe)
- [ ] ask mapping guys asl (laurent)
- [x] try different segmentation techniques (matt)
- [x] read automated mav mapping paper, prototype approach (mau zedong)
- [x] write email sorkine (igl lab) (nasib)
- [ ] construct and find loops using boundary points (matt)

### Implementaion
- [x] Clean up and get main up and running (Moe and Matt)
- [x] Integrate floor plan filtering (Matt)
- [ ] Walls, edges improve hole detection
- [ ] Test robustness of floor plan filtering (Moe)
- [x] determine surfaces of holes (Matt)
- [ ] Hole data structure (Moe)
    - Centroid
    - Point cloud of all boundary points
    - List of poses
    - Hole score
- [ ] Approach to include trajectories
    - False positives rejected
- [ ] Modular scoring mechanism
- [ ] yaml stuff in main (Nasib)
- [ ] 2D headings
- [ ] Write a ReadMe
- [ ] Presentation for 25th of April


###
- [x] Goal 1: Approach for hole detection defined (30.03.2022)
- [ ] Goal 2: Define Holes
- [ ] Goal 3: Implemented holes (TBD)
- [ ] Goal 4: position approach defined (TBD)
- [ ] Goal 5: implemented position approach (TBD)

### nice to haves
- [ ] test edge detection in 3d point clouds (nasib)
